# Pancake Sorting Problem Solver

This project solves the **Pancake Sorting Problem** using various search algorithms and heuristics. The goal is to sort a stack of pancakes of different sizes with the minimum number of flips.

---

## 1. Heuristics
The task is to solve the **pancake sorting problem** using various search algorithms (`UCS`, `A*`, `Greedy`) and compare their performance with three different heuristics:
1. **Gap heuristic**
2. **Out-of-place heuristic**
3. **Total distance from sorted order heuristic**

---

## 2. Metrics to compare:
- Number of nodes expanded by each algorithm.
- The solution (sequence of flips) found by each algorithm.
