# TODO: Pancake Sorting Problem

## Overview
The task is to solve the **pancake sorting problem** using various search algorithms (`UCS`, `A*`, `Greedy`) and compare their performance with three different heuristics:
1. **Gap heuristic**
2. **Out-of-place heuristic**
3. **Total distance from sorted order heuristic**

Metrics to compare:
- Number of nodes expanded by each algorithm.
- The solution (sequence of flips) found by each algorithm.

## Tasks

### 1. **Input Setup**
- [ ] Allow the user to define an initial pancake stack (e.g., `[4, 3, 2, 1]` or randomly generated).
- [ ] Implement a function to verify if a stack is sorted.

---

### 2. **Search Algorithms**

#### 2.1 Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- [ ] Implement UCS for the pancake sorting problem.
- [ ] Heuristics
- [ ] Metrics and Evaluation

#### 2.2 A* Search
- [ ] Implement A* for the pancake sorting problem.
- [ ] Heuristics
- [ ] Metrics and Evaluation

#### 2.3 Greedy Search
- [ ] Implement Greedy search for the pancake sorting problem.
- [ ] Heuristics
- [ ] Metrics and Evaluation

---

### 3. **Heuristics**
- [ ] Gap Heuristic
- [ ] Out-of-Place Heuristic
- [ ] Total Distance Heuristic

---

### 4. **Metrics and Evaluation**
- [ ] Track the total number of nodes expanded by each algorithm.
- [ ] Record and compare performance across heuristics (Gap, Out-of-Place, Total Distance).


---

### 5. **UI**
- [ ] Display the pancake stack visually after every flip.

---

### 6. **Documentation**
- [ ] Provide explanations for each heuristic and algorithm.
- [ ] Include results in a report comparing the performance of the different approaches.
